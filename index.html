<h1>Hi <em> PEEPS</em></h1>
<h3>These cards are some of the rarest,strongest,and most expensive cards in the world!<br>Do you have it?Because some of these cards could make you rich!</h3>
<h4>(I won't be giving details after Lusamine) </h4>
<ol type="a">
  <li><strong><h3>Holographic Base Set Charizard</h3> </strong></li><img src="https://52f4e29a8321344e30ae-0f55c9129972ac85d6b1f4e703468e6b.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/products/pictures/148917.jpg"height="400"width="300">
  <p>Holographic Base Set Charizard is my 1st favorite card because it's one of the rarest cards in the world.<br>
  I don't know if it's more rare than Shadow Lugia,but it does sell for $295 to $2,788!</p>
<li><strong><h3>Shiny Black Charizard GX</h3> </strong></li><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1704/1809/products/en_US-SM3-SV49-charizard_gx-yaa-049ya_66ce80fa-3e8d-47f4-8fce-dc03decf700e_720x.jpg?v=1569085375"height="400" width="300">
<p> Shiny Black Charizard is in my top 14 favorite Pokemon cards for quite a few reasons!<br>
For one thing,it is very rare.You can pull this powerful card from Hidden Fates,and the chance you would get of<br>
pulling this card is 0.0001/10.Shiny Black Charizard is also very powerful.It does 300 on one move:Crimson Storm<br>
and 70 on the other:Wing Attack.This card is one of the most powerful in the world!            </p>
<li><strong><h3>Hyper rare Charizard GX </h3></strong></li><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1704/1809/products/a7df8b478c51771e2044af5b779d18948dd73856_312x.jpg?v=1559365326" height="400" width="300">
<p>You can probably guess why this card is in my top 3 favorite Pokemon cards.It's Hyper rare!<br>
I only have 1 Hyper rare card in my collection:Dragonite GX.And it's promo!This card is just as strong as<br>
the card you <strong>just </strong>read about;pretty strong!                                            </p>
<li><strong><h3> Japanese Gold Reshiram,Charizard tag team </h3></strong> </li><img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/6~gAAOSwRg9dlkKG/s-l1600.jpg"height="400"width="300">
<p> You could <strong>OBVIOUSLY </strong> see why I like this card!It's <strong>GOLD</strong>!<br>
The reason I like Hyper rare Charizard more than gold,is because it's more expensive.Also stronger.<br>
But this card is my 4th favorite!</p>
<li><strong><h3>Full art Olivia </h3></strong></li><img src="https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-0kvv9/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/175715/251222/pokemoncrimsoninvasion111__72350.1509568886.jpg?c=2&imbypass=on"height="400"width="300">
<p>Olivia is the one of the best trainers you can get.And yes,it's better than the two trainers<br>
 down below.I don't exactly know what's so good about Olivia except it's very rare.I friend told me that <br>
Olivia is the best full art trainer.I don't exactly know if that's true,so I put one of the best.</p>
<li><strong><h3>Full art Shiny Cynthia</h3> </strong></li><img src="https://52f4e29a8321344e30ae-0f55c9129972ac85d6b1f4e703468e6b.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/products/pictures/1563054.jpg"height="400"width="300">
<p>What's so good about Cynthia you ask?<br>
Well nothing except it's the most expensive trainer card in the world!
Cynthia is very rare and if you can't pull it out of a pack but if you want it<br>
,be ready to pay a few hundred bucks! </p>
<li><h3><strong>Full art Shiny Lusamine</h3></strong> </li><img src="https://52f4e29a8321344e30ae-0f55c9129972ac85d6b1f4e703468e6b.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/products/pictures/1150405.jpg"height="400"width="300">
<p>Full art Lusamine is the same as Cynthia but it's less expensive.</p>
